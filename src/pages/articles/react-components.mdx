Creating reusable components in React can greatly improve the efficiency and maintainability of your codebase. By building components that can be easily reused throughout your application, you can avoid duplication and ensure that changes made to a component in one location are reflected in all places where it is used.
Here are some tips for creating usable components in React.
Keep it simple
A component should only be responsible for one specific task or piece of functionality. Avoid creating complex components that try to do too much.
For example, if you have a component that is does login handling, it wouldn’t make sense for that same component to also handle rendering store locations for a given product.
Use Props and Context
By passing data to a component via props, you can make the component more flexible and reusable. This allows you to use the same component in different contexts with different data.
Here is an example of a reusable React component that displays a list of items:

```js
import React from 'react'

const List = (props) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default List
```

This component accepts a prop called items, which is an array of objects with an id and a name property. It then iterates over the items array and displays each item in a list using the name property.
To use this component, you would import it into your component and pass in the items prop like this:

```js
const MyComponent = () => {

  const items = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' },
  ];

  return (
      <div>
        <List items={items} />
      </div>
    );
  };
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This component can then be used in multiple places throughout your application, with the ability to display different lists by simply passing in different item props.
Define Props using Typescript
Default props in functional components in React have been deprecated and its recommended to TypeScript from now on when defining prop types.
Learn more about defining prop types using TypeScript and React by reading this.
TypeScript is a popular programming language that adds optional static typing to JavaScript. It can be used in React projects to improve the development experience by catching errors before they reach the browser. When creating a React component in TypeScript, you can define the type of the props and state using interfaces.
Here’s an example of using TypeScript to define prop types.

```js
import React from 'react'

interface Props {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  onClick: (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ name, age, onClick }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example, the component MyComponent accepts three props: name, age, and onClick. The Props interface defines the type of each prop. name is a string, age is a number, and onClick is a function that takes a `React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>` as an argument and returns void. The component uses these props to render some text and a button.
When using this component, you will have to pass the props in a way that respects the types defined in the interface.

```js
<MyComponent
  name="John Doe"
  age={20}
  onClick={(event) => {
    console.log('clicked')
  }}
/>
```

This component can also be written with a state, in that case the type of the state will be defined in another interface and passed as a second type parameter to the React.FC component like this :

```js
interface State {
  count: number;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props, State> = ({ name, age, onClick }, state) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This way you have a clear understanding of the types of your component’s props and state and catch any mistakes early in the development process.

## Test your components

Make sure to test your component thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected and is easy to use. I would recommend using JEST, an excellent testing framework for React. Testing React components with Jest has several benefits, including:

## Improved code quality

By writing and running tests for your React components, you can catch and fix bugs early in the development process, which can help to improve the overall quality of your code.

## Enhanced reliability

By writing tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases, you can ensure that your React components are reliable and function correctly under different conditions.

## Simplified debugging

If a test fails, Jest provides detailed error messages that can help you to identify and fix the problem quickly.

## Improved collaboration

By writing tests, you can provide clear documentation for how your React components are intended to be used, which can be helpful for team members who are working on the same project.

## Enhanced speed and efficiency

Jest has features like snapshot testing and parallel test execution, which can help to speed up the testing process and make it more efficient.

### Final Thoughts

In conclusion, creating reusable React components requires a strong understanding of these practices and business requirements. Remember to always consider the maintainability and scalability of your components, as they will likely be used in multiple projects and potentially by other developers on your team. With practice and attention to detail, you can create high-quality React components that are a valuable asset to any project.
